# Predicting-Extrovert-vs-Introvert-Behavior

## Objective
This project explores a behavioral dataset aimed at distinguishing between extroverted and introverted personality types. The analysis involves exploratory visualization, data preprocessing, and the application of classification models, including Random Forest and Elastic Net, with additional emphasis on threshold tuning and performance evaluation. Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC are used to compare model performance. The goal is to develop a reliable pipeline for classifying personality traits based on social behavior while also assessing each modelâ€™s sensitivity to changes in classification thresholds. 
  The dataset contains 2,900 rows and 8 columns and can be found in the dataset folder or from the original [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data/data)
